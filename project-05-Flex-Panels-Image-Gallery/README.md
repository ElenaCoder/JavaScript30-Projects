## About the project

This is Flex Panels Image Gallery project. The app displays a set of panels, each with an image and some text. When a panel is clicked, it expands to show the full image and the text slides up from the bottom. Clicking on another panel will close the previously opened panel and open the clicked panel. The panels are arranged using CSS Flexbox, which makes it easy to create a responsive layout. The animation effects are created using JavaScript, which adds and removes CSS classes on the panels to control their size and position.
