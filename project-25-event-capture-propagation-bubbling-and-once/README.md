This is Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling and Once project. The goal of this project is to explore how events propagate through the DOM hierarchy and how event listeners can be set to capture events during the capturing phase or bubbling phase. It also introduces the "once" flag, which allows an event listener to be triggered only once and then automatically removed.

- Illustrates the usage of event listeners during the capturing and bubbling phases
- Shows how to use the "once" flag to trigger an event listener only once
