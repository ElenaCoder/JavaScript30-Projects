# JavaScript30 Course Projects

This repository contains my solutions to the projects from the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course by Wes Bos.

## About the course

JavaScript30 is a free 30-day challenge designed to help you improve the vanilla JavaScript skills by building 30 different projects in 30 days. Each project is designed to teach a specific JavaScript concept or technique, and the course is suitable for developers of all skill levels.

For each project, the provided template was utilized as a starting point and further enhanced it by incorporating additional functionality and styling. This approach enables me to gain a deeper understanding of how the projects work and provides an opportunity for hands-on learning. Please note that while I have used the initial projects as a basis, I have modified them to ensure a comprehensive learning experience. Therefore, this repository contains more than just copied projects.
